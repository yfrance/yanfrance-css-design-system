                Biak is a small island located in Cenderawasih Bay near the
                northern coast of Papua, an Indonesian province, and is just
                northwest of New Guinea. Biak is the largest island in its small
                archipelago, and has many atolls, reefs, and corals. The largest
                population centre is at Kota Biak (Biak City) on the south
                coast. The rest of the island is thinly populated with small
                villages. The rain forest-covered Biak Islands have been
                designated the Biak-Numfoor rain forests, especially as they
                have the largest number of endemic bird species of any single
                area in the New Guinea region. There are also numerous reptile
                and amphibian species found here. Among the many snake species
                catalogued by Tom Mendelson during his herpetological survey of
                Biak in the 1990s, the green tree python
                <i>(Morelia viridis)</i> and the amethystine python
                <i>(Morelia amethystina)</i> were quite common. There are
                numerous types of flora in the tropical rain forest of the
                island, including a variety of trees and other commercially
                important species plus the lush vegetation of mangrove swamps.
